# Dashboard Old - Backup Files

This folder contains the original dashboard implementation that was moved here before integrating the new dashboard from noteai-horizon-suite.lovable.app.

## Files Moved:
- `NotesEditor.tsx` - Main notes editor component
- `NotesDashboard.tsx` - Dashboard wrapper component
- `NotesEditorContainer.tsx` - Container for notes editor logic

## Integration Status:
- ✅ Files backed up to dashboard-old folder
- ⏳ Awaiting new dashboard integration
- ⏳ GitHub integration to be set up
- ⏳ New dashboard files to be copied over
- ⏳ Testing and cleanup to follow

## Next Steps:
1. Set up GitHub integration
2. Copy new dashboard files from noteai-horizon-suite.lovable.app
3. Test the new dashboard functionality
4. Remove this backup folder after confirming everything works

## Original Structure Preserved:
The original file structure and imports have been maintained so that if needed, these files can be restored by moving them back to their original locations.
